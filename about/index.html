<p>I am currently a <strong>CS master</strong> student at <strong>USC</strong> and I received my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in <strong>CS</strong> from <strong>USTC</strong> at 2017. I have some backgrounds in machine learning from my FYP and internship, but I prefer coding and developing reliable softwares, so I would like to become a <strong>full-stack SDE</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are my projects (sorted by finish time):</p>

<h2 id="nine-to-five">Nine to Five</h2>

<p>Jan. 2019 - On-going</p>

<p>A 3D Tower Defense Mobile Game made by Unity3D &amp; C#, still under development, will be finished by May. Now I have finished a prototype on Unity simulator, but haven&rsquo;t run on mobile platform. Here are what I have done on Jan. 2019:</p>

<ul>
<li>Built a wave spawner and a drag-and-drop turrets placing system; implemented scripts of enemy, turret, way point</li>
<li>Designed and built the timing system and currency system of this game in singleton pattern</li>
<li>Wrote script for main camera, supporting real-time panning and zooming in game</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a gif demo of current prototype (I know that the UIs are ugly&hellip; will improve on this month):

<h2 id="implementation-of-key-features-in-jos-kernel">Implementation of key features in JOS kernel</h2>

<p>Sept. 2018 - Nov. 2018</p>

<p>JOS is a toy exokernel-like operating system developed by MIT. I will implement some key features in the kernel.</p>

<p>Here are what I have implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li>booting and memory management part.</li>
<li>add support for 4MB big page in memory management</li>
<li>monitor instructions for showing memory mappings in a range of address</li>
<li>running programs in user environment and trap/interrupt handling</li>
<li>intergrated intel fast system call instructions(sysenter/sysexit), improved performance by 2x than using int/iret system call</li>
<li>Supported running on a multiprocessor system and implemented Inter-Process Communication with shared memory</li>
<li>Built a UNIX like on-disk file system to support running a shell on console</li>
<li>Wrote network drivers for E1000 network interface card, which supports running a web server on the top of JOS</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="squaad-web-application">SQUAAD web application</h2>

<p>Jun 2018 - Jul 2018</p>

<p>SQUAAD is a  web application for visualizing software quality related metrics.
I mainly worked on the frontend part, I have optimized dashboard UI with <strong>React</strong>, and introduced some new features to it with <strong>D3.js</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://squaadweb.com">Website</a></p>

<h2 id="travel-and-entertainment-search">Travel and Entertainment Search</h2>

<p>Feb 2018 – May 2018</p>

<p>A web application allowing users to search for places and get details, click <a href="http://search-place.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/">here</a> to see the web demo.
It was built with <strong>Angular 5</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong> in <strong>serverless</strong> architectures and deployed on <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>.
Used Google Places API, Google Maps API, Yelp API to aggregate detailed information of places, including photos, directions, street view, reviews, etc.
Maintained a user&rsquo;s favourite list by HTML5 LocalStorage.
Intergrated Twitter API, one can share a place on twitter by one-click.</p>

<p>There is also an <strong>iOS version</strong> written by <strong>Swift 4</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/xymeow/csci571/tree/master/hw9">here</a> is the repo and a gif demo.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-for-robotic-grasping">Machine Learning for Robotic Grasping</h2>

<p>Feb 2017 – Jun 2017</p>

<p>A robotic grasping platform for deep learning based research and development. I collaborated with 6 team members to design and build an <strong>autonomous data collection system</strong> consists of 2 Kinects, a robot arm and a NVIDIA Jetson kit. The core program runs on the Jetson kit and communicating with other devices by socket. And created <strong>data pipeline</strong> from raw data to neural network with <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. Implemented a <strong>servoing system</strong> for robot based on heuristics algorithm and cross-entropy method(CEM). Built a data analysis tool based on <strong>Faster-RCNN</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="neural-style-visualizer">Neural-Style Visualizer</h2>

<p>Aug 2016</p>

<p>Before TensorBoard was released, it was inconvenient to track the training process of a neural network model, so we want to build a visualizer for this. We chose the recently trending model - Neural Style model as a starter, we have implemented important analytics metrics visualization and realtime interaction with neural-style model.
I worked on visualization and interaction part of project, using <strong>Ajax</strong> and <strong>Highcharts.js</strong></p>

<h2 id="computer-architecture-simulators">Computer Architecture Simulators</h2>

<p>May 2016 - June 2016</p>

<p>When I was taking the course Computer Architecture, I felt writing some simulators for some inportant algorithms and designs could give me a deep understanding of computer architecture. I have written a cache simulator with <strong>Java</strong>, a tomasulo algorithm simulator with <strong>JavaScript(ES6)</strong>, 2 simulators for cache coherence in multi-CPU system with <strong>JavaScript(ES6)</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/xymeow/computer-architecture-simulators">Github repo</a></p>

<p><em>Live demos</em>: <a href="https://xymeow.github.io/computer-architecture-simulators/tomasulo_simulator/">Tomasulo Algorithm</a></p>

<p><a href="https://xymeow.github.io/computer-architecture-simulators/cache_coherence_simulators/snoopingindex">Cache Coherence(bus-snooping)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://xymeow.github.io/computer-architecture-simulators/cache_coherence_simulators/dirindex">Cache Coherence(directory-based)</a></p>

<h2 id="what-plant">What Plant</h2>

<p>May 2015 – May 2016</p>

<p>A common plants identification application based on deep learning. I collaborated with 2 team members to collect plants images both from internet and taken photos. We used our own made dataset to train and optimize the <strong>Caffe</strong> implemented GoogLeNet. It can recognize 24 common plants and achieve a top-1 accuracy by about 80%. Besides, I build up the application based on this model with <strong>Tornado</strong>, and deployed on <strong>AWS EC2</strong> (now we&rsquo;ve terminated it because the cost is too expensive for us, lol)</p>

<h2 id="travel-helper">Travel Helper</h2>

<p>Apr 2016 - May 2016</p>

<p>A travel reservation system built with <strong>Node.js(Express)</strong>, <strong>Jade</strong>, <strong>Materialize</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>, including user panel and admin panel. Users can register and make resevations of hotels, flights, bus in the website, and also check if you have already booked a round trip. If you are a admin, you can:  add/update/remove information of flights, hotels and buses; see all reservations(which user, which flight, all revenues from these resv.); see currently available route graph.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/xymeow/travel-helper">Github repo</a></p>

<h2 id="optimize-the-performance-of-hpcg-benchmark-on-cluster">Optimize the performance of HPCG Benchmark on cluster</h2>

<p>Sep 2015 – Jan 2016</p>

<p>The High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) Benchmark is intended as a complement to the High Performance LINPACK (HPL) benchmark, currently used to rank the TOP 500 computing systems. Our job is optimizing it&rsquo;s performance on a 10 nodes cluster.
We used <strong>MPI, OpenMP</strong> to optimize HPCG, including computational schemes, compiling, memory accessing, communication. And analysis performance bottlenecks with <strong>Vtune, Paramon</strong>, etc. Finally we achieved a performance enhance by 10.5 GPLOP/s.</p>

<h2 id="sina-news-search-engine">Sina news Search Engine</h2>

<p>Oct 2015 – Dec 2015</p>

<p>Course project for Web Information Processing and Application, I have built a search engine for over 100K downloaded Sina news with <strong>Apache Lucene</strong> and <strong>Tomcat</strong>, supported spell checking and related news recommending features. I have replaced the default word segmentation module with <strong>IKAnalyzer</strong>, made it more compatible with Chinese words.</p>
